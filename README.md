# Analysis of Ride-sharing Data by City Type

Analysis and recommendations for Pyber based on total fares per week based on city type: urban, suburban and rural.

## Analysis Overview

# Total Rides, Drivers & Fares

Three of the main categories looked at produced results that were to be expected. This is to say that urban cities had the highest number of _total rides, total drivers and total fares_ with suburban cities coming in second and rural cities coming in third. The results which were not expected had to do with the averages fares, both per ride (fare paid) and per driver (fare received).

# Average Fare per Ride & per Driver

These results were the opposite (and perhaps unexpected) compared to the ones mentioned above. _Average Fare per Ride_ ranked rural first (most expensive) followed by suburban and urban. These results were the same for _Average Fare per Driver_ as well. Drivers made the most money per ride in rural cities, followed by suburban and urban cities.

We also see a discrepancy in the increase in fares generated by each city type _per week_ over a four-month period (January – April). In many ways this graph mirrors the original overview results; urban city types generate the most overall rides, drivers, and fares, followed by suburban and rural. However, this data can be used to show tendancies that are true across all three city types. For example, there is a spike toward the end of February in fares in urban, suburban, and rural city tipes. We also see interesting divergences worth noticing; The number of fares begin to dip or flatten at the end of April in both urban and rural  city types (when the weather begins to warm more consistently) but there is a significant increase in fares from suburban cities. There are also much many more peaks and valleys in the urban cities than there are in rural and suburban centers. 

## Possible Explanations & Recommendations

# Possible Explanations

The apparent inconsistency in why the _Average Fare per Ride_ and _Average Fare per Driver_ are larger in both rural and suburban cities is most likely simply due to the number of total drivers. Urban cities, despite generating the most rides have 780 more total drivers than total rides. Simply put there is too much supply and not enough demand. Rural and suburban cities both have fewer drivers than total rides.

While it might be true that people who live in urban cities would require more rides because fewer of them own their own vehicle (when compared to those who live in suburban and rural cities) the results show that this is not the case. They may generate the most total rides but when compared to the number of drivers offering those rides we see that they are more likely to use some other means (even if it is simply walking) to reach their destination much of the time. 

# Recommendations

# One: Reduce the overall number of drivers in urban cities to meet the level of demand.

A significant number of drivers can be cut without Pyber’s overall profits in urban cities being affected or the average price per fare going up for the customer. 

# Two: Increase the number of drivers in suburban cities on a seasonal basis.

As temperatures get warmer, we see that urban rides and rural rides decrease but suburban rides increase. This indicates people who live in the suburbs travel more during the summer while urban and rural residents do not. 

 # Three: Take a closer look

While the data does support the recommendation of reducing the overall number of drivers in urban areas it is vital to take a closer look at each urban city Pyber has drivers in. Some urban cities had as few as _four_ total drivers in them while others have significantly higher than that. While the number of overall drivers in urban cities should go down some urban cities may actually need their numbers increased to meet demand. 

# Recommendation Summary

The supply of total drivers in urban cities outweighs the demand for those drivers overall, however there are individual urban cities where this is not true so cuts should not be made with one broad stroke but rather on a city-by-city basis. The season demand for rides should not be overlooked as well, where demand might decrease in urban cities it increases in suburban ones, shifting resources on a season basis or having season based drivers could produce more consistent profits for the company overall.
